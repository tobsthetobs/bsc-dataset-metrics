    "# Motion blur metric idea\n",
    "Idea is to find a simple metric which can descibe if an image is blured then maybe hold ratio of blurred images up to non blurred image much like brightness metric idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many methods can be found as it is already a studied field. Methods such as fast fourier transform on a image then looking at the high and low frequency components can lead to making a difficult decision for where to place the thresholds of what constitutes a \"high\" amount of high frequency components etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having therefore searched for already existing algorithms/studies for different methods most of them looking at grayscale statistics. There is a different method: variation of the Laplacian [study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/903548)  "
